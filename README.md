# Image-Colorization
## Aim of this project
Implementing Pix2Pix GAN for Image Colorization and will learn use of deep learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce high-quality, full-color images from grayscale inputs.

### Journey so far
We received a recommendation to watch Andrew NG's introductory videos on Machine Learning, where he covered topics such as loss, cost functions, and the gradient descent algorithm along with their practical applications. Subsequently, we proceeded to explore the concepts of neural networks and deep learning in our next course. During this course, we had the opportunity to write code for various functions and also participated in a crash course on PyTorch. Leveraging PyTorch, we constructed a simple neural network and applied it to classify objects from both the IRIS and MNIST datasets.
