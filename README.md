# Image-Colorization
## Aim of this project
Implementing Pix2Pix GAN for Image Colorization and will learn use of deep learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce high-quality, full-color images from grayscale inputs.

### Journey so far
We were recommended to watch Andrew NG basic Machine Learning videos which were about loss, cost function and gradient descent algorithm and its application.Then with the next course we were going through the concept of neural networks and deep learning. With that we coded some of the fucntions and had done crash course on Pytorch. Using Pytorch we built a basic neural network and implemented it to classify object from IRIS and MNIST dataset.
